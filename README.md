# Sphinx Toolhead
File repo for Sphinx toolhead

Sphinx toolhead is aimed to be a high performance toolhead with an emphasis on part cooling and rigidity. This project was built around the goal of printing a quality 4min benchy.
This project is a work is progress. If you use this toolhead and modify or remix please upload here or reach out and let me know on instagram or discord!

**Cooling Capability:**
Sphinx is designed for high speed printing application and is built for high flow hotends. Currently high speed printing faces two main bottlenecks, flow and cooling. Sphinx attempts to eliminate the cooling bottleneck as much as possible. The printed outlet ducts are kept short to keep aero loses to a minumum. The ducts are made to interface with two cpap hoses and designed to work with two ws7040 cpap blowers in parallel for maximum cooling power. I am currently not using ws7040 blowers, but instead using a hacked air matress compressor that outputs roughly 750L/min of air. I understand that most prints do not need this level of cooling performance so it is planned to make a version to be optimized for a single ws7040 blower.

**Mounting:**
Sphinx mounts to a belt bracket that mounts to linear rail. Currently, it is designed for an MGN12H rail, but it can easily be remixed for MGN9 rails if needed (I perfer MGN12 for needed rigidity at high accels). I have two versions of this belt bracket, one printed and one sheet metal. The sheet metal version is designed to be either water jet cut or laser cut and a few m3 threads will have to be tapped. The printed version will need a few heat set insets. I have printed this out of siraya tech abs-cf, but any stiffer material would work.
